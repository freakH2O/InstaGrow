First of all Run " Install Pre req software " it will install pre req software
then click on oneTimeSetup and Run and follow instructions

The Script has following Pre Requisites:
1. Python 3
2. Chrome Browser
3. Chrome Driver ( Same version as Chrome Browser ) placed in the same directory
as the script
4. Selenium Library( Which will be automatically installed by running Install Pre req software script)


<h1>Problems</h1>
1. This script might end up following a lot of accounts  Now You can deal with this issue by running my other script  named InstaUnfollow Simultaneously with this one which will mass unfollow
2. Can it be bannable?? It has  been specially designed to produce dynamic delays and make automation more humane i have used it for 24 hours straight and it gave me no errors or warnings about botting.
